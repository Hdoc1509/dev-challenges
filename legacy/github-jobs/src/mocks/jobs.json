N\nRelocation? N\nPosition Type Non-Management\n\nPOSITION SUMMARY\n\nOur jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check-in and check-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Specialists take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. Their role goes beyond the traditional front desk to take ownership of the guest experience in the main areas of the hotel with a “guest first” mindset. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, delivering quality meals, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience.\n\nNo matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Specialists – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\nEducation: High school diploma or G.E.D. equivalent.\n\nRelated Work Experience: No related work experience.\n\nSupervisory Experience: No supervisory experience.\n\nLicense or Certification: None\n\nMarriott International is an equal opportunity employer. We believe in hiring a diverse workforce and sustaining an inclusive, people-first culture. We are committed to non-discrimination on any protected basis, such as disability and veteran status, or any other basis covered under applicable law.\n\nWith a fun, casual and residential atmosphere including a full kitchen in every suite, TownePlace Suites are designed for the guest who wants to make the most of long trips. TownePlace Suites is the reliable extended stay hotel that helps guests stay productive and upbeat, with personal touches and fun details that convey a sense of calm and comfort. At TownePlace Suites, we make every guest and team member feel at home. Our associates work side by side and are better together, are thoughtful with an eye for detail and small gestures to brighten any day and are approachable with a smile and friendly hello. In joining TownePlace Suites, you join a portfolio of brands with Marriott International. Be where you can do your best work,​​ begin your purpose, belong to an amazing global​​ team, and become the best version of you.",
