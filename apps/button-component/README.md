## Overview

![screenshot](screenshots/button-component.png)

**Challenge**: Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [x] User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable the button
- [x] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [x] User story: I can have different button sizes
- [x] User story: I can have different colors
- [x] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] User story: I can still access all button attributes
- [x] User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough

### Built With

- [React.js](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/)
- [@hdoc/react-material-icons](/packages/react-material-icons/)
- [@hdoc/react-toggle-theme](/packages/react-toggle-theme/)

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned:

- Integrate easily `BEM` and `React.js` with `classnames`
- Use `Material Icons` for a web project
- Use CSS `custom properties` for re-calculate easily properties values
- Use `ComponentProps` utility for extend component props
