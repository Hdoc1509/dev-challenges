**Challenge**: Create a weather app using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [x] User story: I can see city weather as default, preferably my current location
- [x] User story: I can search for city
- [x] User story: I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
- [x] User story: I can see the date and location of the weather
- [x] User story: I can see according to image for each type of weather
- [x] User story: I can see the min and max degree each day
- [ ] User story: I can see wind status and wind direction
- [ ] User story: I can see humidity percentage
- [ ] User story: I can see a visibility indicator
- [ ] User story: I can see the air pressure number
- [ ] User story(optional): I can request my current location weather
- [ ] User story(optional): I can convert temperature in Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
