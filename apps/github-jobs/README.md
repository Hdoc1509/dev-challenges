Challenge: Create a job search using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [x] User story: I can see a list of jobs in a city by default
- [x] User story: I can search for jobs with a given keyword
- [x] User story: I can search for jobs with a city name, zip code, or other location
- [ ] User story: I can select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options
- [ ] User story: I can search for a full-time job only
- [ ] User story: I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- [ ] User story: When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- [ ] User story: When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
- [ ] User story (optional): I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default
- [ ] User story (optional): I can see jobs on different pages, 5 items on each page
