- [ ] User story: I can search for a full-time job only
- [ ] User story: I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- [ ] User story: When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- [ ] User story: When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
