**Challenge**: Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

- [x] User story: I can see error state
- [x] User story: I can choose to disable input
- [x] User story: I can choose to have helper text
- [x] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
- [x] User story: I can have different input sizes
- [x] User story: I can have different colors
- [x] User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
- [x] User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
- [x] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- [x] User story: I can still access all input attributes
- [x] User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
